visualEEG is a MATLAB/GUIDE based toolbox which can be used for very basic analysis of EEG/EMG/TMS data. The goal of this project is to develop a single window interactive tool for beginners. For serious research, we recommend EEGLAB https://bitbucket.org/sccn_eeglab/eeglab.git.

## Compatibility
Currently visualEEG is being developed on macOS High Sierra, MATLAB 2017a. However, in the past, it has been tested to work on OSX El Capitan MATLAB R2015b; Windows 7, MATLAB 2014a; and Linux (Ubuntu LTS 14.04), MATLAB 2012b.

## Installation

1. Clone the git repository. Or, download a compressed copy.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/GallVp/visualEEG
    ```

2. From MATLAB file explorer, add the folder/repository *visualEEG* to `path` by selecting the *Selected folders and subfolders* option. Run `visualEEG.m` file.
